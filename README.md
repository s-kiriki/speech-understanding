## Attention  

This API does not return a real "answer" to an input sentence.  
If you want the application to display actual train transfer information in response to an input sentence  
(e.g., "I want to go to Tameike-sanno from Yokohama by train"),   
you need to make a further inqury into a search engine that provides train transfer  information by entering the words "Yokohama" and "Tameike-sanno" returned from the API.
